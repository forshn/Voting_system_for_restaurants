## REST API application of voting system for deciding where to have lunch using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC

> - 2 types of users: admin and regular users
> - Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
> - Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
> - Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
> - Only one vote counted per user
> - If user votes again the same day:
    >     - If it is before 11:00 we assume that he changed his mind.
>     - If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed
